# Dagger2-CLEAN-MVP Example

Sample project with the first steps of my approach to Android CLEAN architecture, based on elegant solutions from respected developers.
Features a ListView containing users, obtained from randomuser API.
Some of the aspects covered on this project are:

* Dependency Injection using [Dagger2][6].
* Elegant ~~ListView~~ **RecyclerView** implementation using [Renderers][15].
* Elegant View management using Jake Wharton's [ButterKnife][11].
* Image loading using [picasso][12], round transformations using **PorterDuff**.
* Model-View-Presenter + Interactor + DataSource layers, where a Dagger-injected **Interactor** can query different **DataSource**s:
  * a REST Api using [retrofit][13]
  * a local **JSON file**
  * a class generating **mock** instances
* A less-boilerplate **MVP** implementation using generics (splitted into Presenter / APresenter / APresenterImpl).
* Retro-compatible architecture (minSdkVersion is 8)

This project has taken the following **talks**, **articles**, and **repos** as inspiration (it wouldn't have been possible without them)

* [Jorge Barroso - Forgetting Android][3]
* [Pedro Vicente Gómez Sánchez - EffectiveAndroidUI][2]
* [Dependency Injection on Android - Pedro Gómez][4]
* [Dagger2 Example by David Lázaro (dlazaro66)][5]
* [Google's Dagger Example][6]
* [Antonio Leiva's MVP Example][7] and [Blog article][8]
* [protohipster - Jorge Barroso][9]
* [UpcomingMoviesMVP - Jose Luis Martín][14]

Desirable TODOs

- [ ] A better Thread management to do heavier operations outside the UI Thread
- [X] RecyclerViews, Renderers2.0
- [ ] More DataSources like ~~parse~~, Google Cloud, Azure, protobuf...
- [X] Unit tests
- [ ] UI tests
- [ ] Refactor to add Repository layer
